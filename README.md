## My process

  ### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - JavaScript custom properties
  - Media Queries for Mobile Responsive
  - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library
  - [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

  ## What I learned

  This challenge have taught me how to properly research JavaScript examples on how to fetch available free data/API and to render that information into your own design for presentation.

  ### Continued development

  One of the main areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects is JavaScript and with other languages like PHP.
